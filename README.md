<h3>How do I suggest an improvement, ask a question or report an issue?</h3>
If you want to do anything from above, just create a new issue at the [Issues section](https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/General-Discussion/issues) . Please be constructive and on-topic. In case you are reporting an issue either here, or at some specific app's repository, please give as much useful information as possible, ideally with steps to reproduce. Being able to reproduce a bug and understand it can really speed up the fixing.

<h3>How can I suggest an edit to a file?</h3>
Creating pull requests with some changes is a lot simpler than most people think. Most suggestions are related to the translated strings, the steps are as follows:

1. Log in to Github
2. Find the file with the strings (app/src/main/res/values(-xx)/strings , i.e. https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-Gallery/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
3. Click the pencil button at the top right corner of the file
4. Edit the file with your suggestions*
5. Enter a commit message to the first row under the file, optionally a description in the second one
6. Click Propose file change

\* Change only the string which is between ">" and "\</string\>", _not_ the first one after the "name=" tag. That will save me a lot of headaches.
